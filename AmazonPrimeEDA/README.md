# Amazon Prime Video Users Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains data and scripts for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Amazon Prime Video Users Dataset. The dataset is available for download from [Kaggle](https://rb.gy/j1q1sg).

## Dataset Overview

The Amazon Prime Users Dataset contains information about 2500 fictional users of the Amazon Prime subscription service. Each entry in the dataset includes details such as the user's name, email address, location, subscription plan, payment information, and engagement metrics.
